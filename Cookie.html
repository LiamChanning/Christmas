                        INGREDIENTS
                    </br>
2 sticks (1cup, 8 oz, 224 gr) unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes (important that the butter is cold so the dough doesn't need to be chilled)
</br>
2 1/2 cups (20 oz, 560 gr) lightly packed dark brown sugar (you can also use light brown sugar for a more mild flavor)
</br>
2 large eggs, cold
</br>
1/2 tsp kosher salt
</br>
1 TBSP ground ginger
</br>
2 tsp ground cinnamon
</br>
1/2 tsp ground clove (optional, but recommended)
</br>
1/2 tsp allspice (optional, but recommended)
</br>
4 cups (17 oz, 476 gr) all-purpose flour (measured properly)
                </br>
            </br>
        </br>
        Instructions
    </br>
    Preheat your oven to 350 F (170 C). Line two sheet pans with parchment paper and set aside.
</br>
    Put the cold cubed butter and brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fit with a paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer. Mix the butter and sugar on medium speed for about 3 minutes, until well combined. It won't really be creamed. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
</br>
    Add the egg, salt, ginger, cinnamon, clove, and allspice (if using) to the bowl. Mix for 1 minute more on medium speed until all the ingredients are incorporated. Scrape down the bowl again.
</br>
    With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the flour into the bowl. Mix just until combined. This will be a very thick dough, and you may need to knead it gently with your hands until it comes together.
</br>
    Gather the dough together into a ball and divide it in half. Lightly flour a clean work surface and start with half of the dough. Lightly flour the top of the dough and a rolling pin. Roll out to about 1/4"-1/3" thick. Thicker will produce softer cookies and thinner will produce crispier cookies. Alternatively, you can roll the dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper.
</br>
    Cut out your cookies and place them on a parchment or silicone mat lined baking sheet.
</br>
    Bake at 350 F (170 C) for 9-12 minutes. I like my cookies cut out 1/3" thick and baked for about 10 minutes. This produces cookies with slightly crispy edges and soft centers. Longer baking times will produce crispier cookies.
</br>
    If you are decorating the cookies with candies and sprinkles, as I did in the pictures, press them into the cookies when they are still hot. If you are frosting the cookies, allow them to cool completely first. I like to use this super simple 3 ingredient icing.
</br>
    Store cooled cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.
